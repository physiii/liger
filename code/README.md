lws-esp32-test-server-demos
===========================

## For use with lws-esp32-factory

This relies on setup capability provided by

https://github.com/warmcat/lws-esp32-factory

which runs from the "factory" partition on ESP32.  This app is
designed to run from the 2.9MB OTA partition.

## New!

This includes the latest lws HTTP/2 support now, improved
memory management for headers, and mbedTLS wrapper fixes to
improve speed when multiple SSL connections are coming.

## About this demo

This demo is the standard lws test server using the standard lws test
protocol plugins.

When you open the page the html / png assets are served over http/2
or http/1 depending on how you connected.  Then the browser connects
back over http/1 and upgrades to ws.

## Build

This was built and tested againt esp-idf e5b2c1cf4c08471c740d3f4e5f86012aa1f32894 from Nov 24.

Clone and bring in the lws submodule (it's unpatched lws master)

```
  $ git clone git@github.com:warmcat/lws-esp32-test-server-demos.git
  $ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

```
 $ make flash_ota ; make monitor
```

## Using the lws test apps

See what IP your ESP32 got from your AP, the visit it in your browser
using, eg https://192.168.2.249

If your dhcp server provides your dns, you can also reach the device
using lws-serial, eg, https://lws-1234 or https://lws-1234.local

 - dumb increment should be updating at ~20Hz

 - mirror should let you draw in the canvas... open a second browser
   instance and they should be able to see each other's drawings

 - close testing should work

 - server info should reflect browsers open on the site dynamically

 - POST tests should pass the string and upload the file if one given

 - The button at the bottom should reset you into the setup / factory app

 - The "War and Peace" demo should load the 4MB text from the 1.2MB gzipped zip
   file directly, using gzipped data to the browser.
